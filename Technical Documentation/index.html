    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </header>
  <p>JavaScript is a programming language that was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It is one of the three core technologies used in web development, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
  <p>JavaScript can be used to create interactive websites, dynamic web applications, and server-side applications using Node.js.</p>
  <p>One of the unique features of JavaScript is that it can run on both the client side (in the browser) and the server side (using Node.js).</p>
  <code>console.log('Hello, world!');</code>
  <p>The above code is an example of a simple JavaScript program that prints 'Hello, world!' to the console. The console is a tool used by developers to debug and test their code.</p>
  <li>JavaScript Syntax</li>
  <p>JavaScript syntax is similar to other programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. It uses a combination of keywords, operators, and expressions to create statements that can be executed by the browser or server.</p>
  <li>Comments</li>
  <p>Comments are used to add notes to your code that are not executed by the browser or server. They are useful for documenting your code and explaining how it works.</p>
  <li>Variables</li>
  <p>Variables are used to store data values that can be used later in your code. They are declared using the 'var', 'let', or 'const' keywords.</p>
  <li>Data Types</li>
  <p>JavaScript has several data types including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. Each data type has its own unique properties and methods that can be used to manipulate and work with the data.</p>
  <li>Operators</li>
  <p>Operators are used to perform actions on variables and values. JavaScript has several types of operators including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.</p>
  <p>By understanding the basics of JavaScript syntax, comments, variables, data types, and operators, you can begin to create powerful web applications that can run on both the client and server side.</p>

          <h2>Variables</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Variables are used to store data values in JavaScript...</p>
<p>Variables are an essential part of any programming language, and JavaScript is no exception. In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values that can be used later in the program.</p>
<p>When you declare a variable in JavaScript, you are essentially telling the computer to set aside a piece of memory to store a particular value.</p>
<p>There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript: using the "var" keyword, the "let" keyword, or the "const" keyword.</p>
<p>The "var" keyword was used to declare variables in older versions of JavaScript, but it is still supported in modern versions. However, it is generally recommended to use "let" or "const" instead.</p>
<p>The "let" keyword is used to declare variables that can be reassigned later in the program. This is useful if you need to update the value of a variable as the program runs.</p>
<p>The "const" keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. This is useful if you want to make sure that a particular value stays the same throughout the program.</p>
<p>When you declare a variable, you can also assign a value to it at the same time. For example, you could declare a variable called "myVariable" and assign it the value 5 like this: <code>let myVariable = 5;</code>.</p>
<p>Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed, which means that you do not need to specify a data type when you declare a variable. Instead, the data type is determined automatically based on the value that is assigned to the variable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>var</li>
          <li>let</li>
          <li>const</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Data Types</h2>
  </header>
  <p>JavaScript has seven different data types:</p>
  <code>let name = 'John';</code>
  <code>let age = 30;</code>
  <code>let isStudent = true;</code>
  <li>Strings</li>
  <li>Numbers</li>
  <li>Booleans</li>
  <li>Null and Undefined</li>
  <li>Objects</li>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Symbols</li>
  <p>A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, either single or double quotes. They can contain letters, numbers, and symbols, and can be concatenated using the + operator.</p>
  <p>Numbers can be either whole numbers or decimal numbers, and can be used in mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
  <p>Booleans are values that are either true or false. They are often used in conditional statements to determine the flow of a program.</p>
  <p>Null and undefined are special values in JavaScript. Null represents the intentional absence of any object value, while undefined is used to indicate a variable that has not been assigned a value.</p>
  <p>Objects are a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be of any data type. They are created using curly braces and can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.</p>
  <p>Arrays are a collection of values that are ordered and can be accessed by index. They are created using square brackets and can contain values of any data type.</p>
  <p>Symbols are a new data type in JavaScript that were introduced in ECMAScript 6. They are unique and immutable values that can be used as property keys in objects.</p>
  <p>It is important to be aware of the different data types in JavaScript, as it can affect how your code behaves and interacts with other parts of your program.</p>
  <p>One of the most powerful features of JavaScript is its ability to dynamically change data types based on the context in which they are used. For example, a variable that was previously assigned a string value can later be assigned a number value.</p>
  <p>JavaScript also has built-in methods and functions for working with different data types, such as the parseInt() and parseFloat() functions for converting strings to numbers, or the typeof operator for determining the data type of a variable.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>
          <h2>Functions</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks...</p>
        <code>function greet(name) { console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); }</code>
  <header>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help us write modular and organized code, making it easier to read, debug, and maintain.</p>
  <p>In JavaScript, functions can be defined using the function keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses (). Inside the parentheses, you can specify the function's parameters, which are like variables that hold the values passed to the function when it's called.</p>
  <code>function add(a, b) { return a + b; }</code>
  <p>To call a function, you simply use its name followed by parentheses and any arguments you want to pass in. The function will then execute the code inside its curly braces and return a value if there's a return statement.</p>
  <p>Functions can also be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions. This makes them extremely versatile and powerful building blocks for complex applications.</p>
  <code>const multiply = function(a, b) { return a * b; }</code>
  <p>JavaScript also supports arrow functions, which are a shorthand syntax for creating simple functions that have a single expression as their body. Arrow functions are often used in functional programming and can make your code more concise and readable.</p>
  <p>Functions can also have default parameter values, which are used if no value is passed for that parameter. This can help simplify function calls and make your code more robust.</p>
  <code>function greet(name = 'world') { console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); }</code>
  <p>Finally, JavaScript also has higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. This allows for powerful abstractions and code reuse, and is a key feature of functional programming.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Objects">
        <header>
          <h2>Objects</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Objects are collections of related data and functionality...</p>
        <code>let person = { name: 'John', age: 30, isStudent: true };</code>
  <p>Objects are collections of related data and functionality that can be grouped together under a single variable name. They are used to represent real-world entities, such as a person or a car, and are an essential part of JavaScript programming.</p>
  <code>let person = { name: 'John', age: 30, isStudent: true };</code>
  <p>In JavaScript, objects can be created using object literal notation, which involves defining the object using curly braces, with each property separated by a comma. Properties consist of a key and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
  <p>Objects can also be created using constructor functions, which are functions that are used to create new instances of an object. Constructor functions use the 'this' keyword to refer to the new object being created, and can be used to set default values for properties.</p>
  <p>Objects can have methods, which are functions that are defined as properties of an object. Methods can be used to perform actions on the object or to return values based on the object's properties.</p>
  <p>One of the most powerful features of objects in JavaScript is their ability to be nested. This means that objects can have other objects as properties, which allows for the creation of complex data structures.</p>
  <p>When working with objects in JavaScript, it is important to remember that objects are passed by reference, not by value. This means that when you pass an object to a function, you are passing a reference to the object, not a copy of the object.</p>
  <p>To access the properties of an object in JavaScript, you can use either dot notation or bracket notation. Dot notation involves using a period to access the property directly, while bracket notation involves using square brackets and the property name as a string.</p>
  <p>JavaScript also provides several built-in methods for working with objects, such as Object.keys(), which returns an array of the keys in an object, and Object.values(), which returns an array of the values in an object.</p>
  <p>Finally, it is worth noting that JavaScript has a number of built-in objects that are used for specific purposes, such as the Date object for working with dates and times, and the Math object for performing mathematical operations.</p>
  <code>let car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2020 };</code>
